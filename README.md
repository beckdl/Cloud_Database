# Overview

This is my attempt at making a cloud database that interacts with Google Firebase.
The program opens up a CLI interface that initiates a connection to a Cloud Database for a database of a to-do list. You can pick different options using numbers. If you do not already have the key you will have to create a database for yourself and get a Service key.

# Cloud Database
I am using Google Firebase as the Cloud Database
It is a simple database that writes to and takes from a to-do list

# Development Environment
Developed in VSCode
Language used was Python with the Firebase Admin SDK
# Useful Websites
- [Firestore Tutorial](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

# Future Work

- Implementation of access without using key.
